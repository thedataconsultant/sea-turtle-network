            <h2>Mission</h2>
            
            <p>Building a company is one of the most meaningful paths one can take, an act of personal creation taking immense courage to go all in down a path of uncertainty. </p>

            <p>However, the process to jump down the deep end is often surrounded by fear. The what-if's and comparisons to known paths make the decision to plunge in even harder: going to consulting, high finance, big tech. This is especially so for folks that have dedicated their lives to excel in the structured nature of early pathways: getting into top universities, getting the best internships.</p>

            <p>For a few individuals though, entrepreneurship is a calling. Prior to building a company, the best tend to know that this is the only path that makes sense to them. They've observed something in the world, or felt an insight so deep in their bones that it's the only thing they can think about. It's certaintly what I felt. The fear might definitely still be present, but it's sitting on the edge of a cliff. One push, some acknowledgement that this is the right path, and these individuals will sacrifice everything to commit to this path. They will not look back.</p>

            <p>We believe that the fear is killable. Believe it or not, fundraising is easy. Building a company and solving a scalable, monetizable problem is challenging, but it's solvable, and people no smarter, and even dumber than you have succeeded before.</p>

            <p>All it takes is the willingness to start, to be equipped with the foundations to build momentum, and to never give up. Our mission is to help certain individuals leap off the cliff. To begin their story, and to have the support foundations to affirm their direction.</p>

            <h2>Execution</h2>

            <p>We are putting in 2-3 angel checks in 2025, for individuals who fit the following characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Indonesians, up to 29 years old, who have completed or are nearly completed with their undergraduate or graduate degrees in the US. While we believe great founders can come from anywhere, as investors this is the group of people we can assess the best.</li>
                <li>A founding team, including a technical builder that is excellent at their craft, and can take ideas to reality. The definition of a "technical builder" may differ between industries, and we are open to interpretation. </li>
                <li>Ideally at least 2 years of experience out of university, but we can make exceptions for outstanding individuals.</li>
                <li>Have obsessively began executing towards their mission, without the permission of anyone to start. You have launched a product or service, even if imperfect. This is a non-negotiable especially in the age of AI.</li>
                <li>Who can truly look past "prestige-laden" paths (IB, MBB, Big Tech), and view this as a waste of their true potential.</li>
                <li>Have had an experience of being truly obsessed, and working relentlessly towards excellence at anything in life, no matter what it was or is. </li>

            </ul>

            <p>This is more than a check. This is a life-long membership in an intentionally small, intensely obsessed group of Indonesian founders that is designed to support and augment each other's long-term journeys. Obsessed individuals often feel a sense of loneliness, walking uncharted territory. But we want the brave to be surrounded by others like them, and to be elevated to their full potential.</p>
            <p>We will support you intensely through your startup's 0-1 journey, almost like another co-founder. We are highly incentivized to help you succeed, and this is why the bar for joining this community is set extremely high. We will introduce you to the best investors globally, hustle with you to close clients, and ensure everything related to your company building from a legal, governance, strategic perspective is well set up. </p>
            <p>This community will be small, and grow slowly over time. The intention is to maintain this bar at the highest standards. There is no fixed programming, and there is nothing forced. Members will have the opportunity to angel invest in new members.</p>

            <p>If this resonates with you, please send your best cold e-mail introducing yourself / yourselves to <a href="seaturtleangelnetwork@gmail.com">seaturtleangelnetwork@gmail.com</a>.</p>


            <h2>Post Pre-Seed Founders</h2>
            <p>If our mission resonates and you would like to join this community, but you are a post pre-seed Founder, don't worry.</p>
            <p>As long as you have the intention of committing intensely to the people within this community, to uplift each other's successes and to problem solve through obstacles, through our long-term journeys, we can still make room.</p>
            <p>Please also send your best cold e-mail introducing yourselves to <a href="seaturtleangelnetwork@gmail.com">seaturtleangelnetwork@gmail.com</a></p>
